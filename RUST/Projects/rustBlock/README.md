A simple blockchain implementation in rust. This is a learning project
with two goals: to learn the intricacies of blockchains and as a first
serious rust project.

The blockchain implementation is heavily based on that of bitcoinwith the noticeable
exclusion of the proof-of-work. This simple implementation is intended
to run among (mostly) trusted nodes.
